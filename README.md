## Using the 'print' command

The 'print' statement is one of the simplest commands in Python. 
```python
print("your text goes here")
```
It does exactly what you might expect, prints the words "*your text goes here*" verbatim onto the screen.

#### Some things to watch out for:

- The `print` command has no capital letter.
- The text in parentheses () is called a [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str) (i.e., a sequence of any characters such as letters, numbers and symbols).
- Strings need to be enclosed "quotation marks".

These simple rules for code are called the syntax. This is important as incorrect syntax will result in broken code that wonâ€™t work (i.e., a syntax error).

## Today's Lesson:

Try running the python code in this repository. You'll get some nasty looking red text with the word `SyntaxError`. Woops.

To fix this we need to switch to the main.py file (i.e, the python file) in this repository. From there, follow the instructions written in the comments, that is the green text that start with the hash (#) symbol.

## Real-World Application:

The `print` statement can be useful for adding context to your analysis. For example, imagine the results of a calculation is `0.26`, this is not very informative on its own. Insted, we can add text (in the form of a python string) and formatting to these results to give readers a better understanding of the data:
```
26% of the GP registered population
```
