        "The user is asked a question and their response is stored in a variable.\r\n",
        "A loop is started with a condition that can be explained as ‘while the user gets the answer wrong’ - this is a typical use of the not equal to operator.  It often helps to explain to students that, for this sort of problem, the loop should run while the input is NOT what they want/correct.\r\n",

        "Inside the loop, the user is given an error message - not essential but good practice for usability.\r\n",
        "Inside the loop the user is given another chance to input - this is essential! Missing this step means that the user never has a chance to change their answer.  Therefore the loop condition will never change from true to false.  This creates an infinite loop that never ends.  Students often make this error.\r\n",
